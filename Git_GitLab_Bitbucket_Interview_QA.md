# Git Interview Questions and Answers

## 1. Describe the difference between `rebase` and `merge` in Git. When would you use one over the other?
- **Rebase**: Reapplies commits on top of another base commit. It creates a linear history and is cleaner.
- **Merge**: Combines two branches together. It retains the original history and creates a merge commit.
- **When to use**: Use rebase for a cleaner history in a feature branch; use merge to preserve history when integrating long-lived branches.

## 2. How would you resolve a complex merge conflict that spans multiple files and involves multiple team members?
- **Steps**:
  1. Identify conflicting files using `git status`.
  2. Discuss with team members to understand the intent behind the conflicting changes.
  3. Manually edit files to resolve conflicts, using `git diff` and `git mergetool` if necessary.
  4. Test the resolved code thoroughly.
  5. Stage the resolved files with `git add` and commit the merge.

## 3. Explain the concept of Git's "detached HEAD" state. How can you recover from this state if necessary?
- **Detached HEAD**: Occurs when you checkout a commit instead of a branch. You're not on a branch, so commits made here may be lost.
- **Recover**: Create a new branch from the detached HEAD using `git checkout -b <new-branch>` or checkout an existing branch to exit this state.

## 4. What are Git submodules, and when would you use them? How do you manage updates and synchronization for submodules?
- **Submodules**: Repositories within a repository. Used to manage dependencies in separate repositories.
- **Updates**: Use `git submodule update --remote` to pull the latest changes. Add and commit changes in the parent repository to synchronize.

## 5. How do you handle large binary files in a Git repository? What are some strategies or tools you might use?
- **Tools**: Git LFS (Large File Storage) to manage large binaries without bloating the repository.
- **Strategies**: Avoid committing large binaries directly. Use external storage like S3 or Git LFS.

## 6. Discuss the implications of Git's internal storage mechanism (objects, blobs, trees, and commits) on repository performance.
- **Implications**: Large numbers of small commits or large files can bloat the `.git` directory. Regular maintenance (`git gc`) helps improve performance.

## 7. Can you describe a scenario where you would use `git reflog`? How does it help in recovering lost commits?
- **Scenario**: If you accidentally reset or delete a branch, `git reflog` tracks all changes to HEAD. You can recover lost commits using `git reflog`.

## 8. How do you perform a Git bisect to find the commit that introduced a bug?
- **Steps**:
  1. Run `git bisect start`.
  2. Mark the bad commit with `git bisect bad` and a good commit with `git bisect good`.
  3. Git will check out commits in between to find the one that introduced the bug.
  4. Mark each commit as good or bad until Git identifies the problematic commit.

# GitLab Interview Questions and Answers

## 1. Explain how GitLab CI/CD pipelines work. How would you design a pipeline for a multi-environment deployment (e.g., staging and production)?
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Automated processes defined in `.gitlab-ci.yml` that run jobs sequentially or in parallel.
- **Design**: Use stages (build, test, deploy) and environment-specific jobs. Use `only` and `except` rules to control where jobs run.

## 2. Describe the use and benefits of GitLab’s Auto DevOps feature. What are its limitations?
- **Auto DevOps**: Predefined CI/CD configuration for building, testing, and deploying applications. It simplifies setup for common use cases.
- **Limitations**: Limited customization. Best for simple projects; may not fit complex pipelines.

## 3. How would you configure GitLab Runner to execute jobs in a Docker container? What are the advantages and potential pitfalls?
- **Configuration**: Install Docker and GitLab Runner. Register the runner with GitLab, specifying Docker as the executor.
- **Advantages**: Consistency and isolation of environments.
- **Pitfalls**: Docker-in-Docker (DinD) can be slow and complex.

## 4. Discuss the GitLab branching strategy you recommend for a large team with multiple parallel projects.
- **Strategy**: GitFlow or a simplified variant with feature branches, release branches, and a protected main branch. This allows parallel development and stable releases.

## 5. What are GitLab’s security features? How do you set up and manage access controls and permissions in a GitLab instance?
- **Security Features**: 2FA, Code review approvals, Protected branches, SAST, DAST.
- **Access Control**: Manage using groups, roles (Guest, Reporter, Developer, Maintainer, Owner), and protected branches.

## 6. Explain the concept of GitLab's "Merge Request Approvals" and how they can be configured to enforce code review policies.
- **Merge Request Approvals**: Define rules that require one or more reviewers to approve code before it can be merged.
- **Configuration**: Set in project settings or `.gitlab-ci.yml`, specifying the number of required approvers and any specific approvers.

## 7. How do you manage and monitor GitLab’s performance and resource usage in a self-hosted environment?
- **Management**: Use GitLab's built-in monitoring, Prometheus integration, and resource usage dashboards.
- **Monitoring**: Regularly check CPU, memory, and disk usage; adjust resources as needed.

## 8. Can you walk me through how GitLab integrates with Kubernetes for continuous deployment?
- **Integration**: Use GitLab’s Kubernetes integration to deploy to a cluster directly from CI/CD pipelines. Define environments and use `.gitlab-ci.yml` to deploy applications.

# Bitbucket Interview Questions and Answers

## 1. Discuss how Bitbucket Pipelines work and compare them to other CI/CD solutions like GitLab CI/CD or GitHub Actions.
- **Bitbucket Pipelines**: YAML-based CI/CD service integrated into Bitbucket. Similar to GitLab CI/CD but simpler; less flexible than GitHub Actions.

## 2. What are Bitbucket’s branching strategies, and how do they help manage parallel development and release cycles?
- **Branching Strategies**: GitFlow, feature branching, or release branching. Helps isolate development and stabilize releases.

## 3. Explain how you would set up and use Bitbucket’s deployment permissions and environments to control access and deployment processes.
- **Setup**: Define deployment environments in Bitbucket. Use branch permissions and deployment permissions to control who can deploy to specific environments.

## 4. How do you handle large files in Bitbucket repositories? What are Bitbucket’s solutions for managing large binaries?
- **Handling**: Use Bitbucket's Git LFS support for large files, similar to GitHub's solution.

## 5. Describe the integration process between Bitbucket and Jira. How does this integration enhance development workflows?
- **Integration**: Link repositories to Jira projects. Commits, branches, and pull requests automatically link to Jira issues, enhancing visibility and traceability.

## 6. What are the best practices for using Bitbucket’s pull request workflows to ensure code quality and maintainability?
- **Best Practices**: Use code reviews, CI/CD checks, and enforce branch permissions. Automate checks like linting and testing in Pipelines.

## 7. How would you troubleshoot a failed Bitbucket Pipeline? What steps would you take to identify and resolve the issue?
- **Troubleshooting**: Review the Pipeline logs, identify the failed step, check configuration or environment issues, rerun the Pipeline, and adjust as necessary.
